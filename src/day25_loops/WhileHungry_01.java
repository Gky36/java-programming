/*
    While, and do while loops, can be used with numbers as conditions, or boolean variables,
    boolean statements.

    another type of loop in java is FOR LOOP:
    2 types of FOR LOOP:
        1) for loop with iterator/counter
        2)for each loop-> works with collections, need array topic to learn.

    FOR LOOP -> normally used when we know how many times it will repeat beforehand.
